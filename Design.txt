A simple txt file to keep track of my progress and how I designed this application

First step, had to figure out how to read files, used the fs module for this.
How to read command line args : process.argv (array)

Had to configure my package.json to use esrun module and start my application, the usual method using node did not work as I cannot run node scripts on work laptop lol 

In order to pass command line arguments, need to use -- so, a simple input on command line might look like:

npm run start -- [-option] [file]
npm run start -- -l test.txt

app.ts is the starting point of the application, send the operation and filepath as parameter to the WC funtion in index.ts file.
